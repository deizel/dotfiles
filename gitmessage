# Scope and summarize changes in about 80 characters
#
# More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to no more than
# 100 characters. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
# subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
# blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
# you omit the body entirely); various tools like `log`, `shortlog`
# and `rebase` can get confused if you run the two together.
#
# Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
# are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
# Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequenses of this
# change? Here's the place to explain them.
#
# Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
#
#  - Bullet points are okay, too
#
#  - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
#    by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
#    vary here
#
# Put references to the issue(s) at the bottom, like this:
#
# Closes: #123
# Refs: #456, #789
#
# and references to other resources below them:
